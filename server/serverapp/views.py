    The way to get the words/text specific to individual attendees given a meeting is to
    take the returned ids of attendees, and then use that to query from localhost:8000/attendee/?insertqueryhere

    A way to get the percentage of words spoken by an attendee is to divide the attendee's total text count by the
    meeting's text count

    ex: i query form localhost:8000/attendee/1,2,3,4 and get the json representing what was said by attendees 1,2,3,4
    for a given meeting

    each attendee has data for how many words they spoke, so that can just be divided by total word counts of the meeting
